1
00:00:16,978 --> 00:00:18,969
-I'm sorry!
-Oh, my God! That's it!

2
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:21,328
You just barge in here
and you don't knock?

3
00:00:21,538 --> 00:00:23,335
You have no respect
for my privacy?

4
00:00:23,538 --> 00:00:25,051
-Rachel, wait!
-No, you wait!

5
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:26,486
Can I just say one thing?

6
00:00:26,698 --> 00:00:27,608
What?! What?

7
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:30,969
That's a relatively open weave
and I can still see your. . .

8
00:00:31,858 --> 00:00:32,654
. . .nippular area.

9
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:39,686
The One With the Boobies

11
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:26,614
Honey, honey. . .

12
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:29,372
. . .tell them the story about
your patient. . .

13
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:31,773
. . .who thinks things are
other things.

14
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:35,016
Like when the phone rings
and she takes a shower. . . .

15
00:01:36,738 --> 00:01:38,376
That's pretty much it.

16
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:42,013
But you tell it really well, sweetie.

17
00:01:42,258 --> 00:01:43,168
Thanks.

18
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:46,972
Now go away so we can
talk about you.

19
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:48,811
Okay. I'll miss you.

20
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:51,814
Isn't he great?

21
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:54,288
He's so cute. And he
likes you so much.

22
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:55,408
I know. I know.

23
00:01:55,658 --> 00:01:58,491
He's so sweet.
And so complicated, you know?

24
00:01:58,738 --> 00:02:01,810
And for a shrink,
he's not too shrinky. You know?

25
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:03,935
Think you'll do it on his couch?

26
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:06,817
I don't know. That's a little weird.

27
00:02:07,058 --> 00:02:08,377
It's vinyl. . . .

28
00:02:12,578 --> 00:02:14,091
You guys want anything else?

29
00:02:14,338 --> 00:02:15,771
-Could I have--
-We're all out.

30
00:02:15,978 --> 00:02:17,206
Anybody else?

31
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:19,890
Did I miss something?

32
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:23,170
No, she's still upset
because I saw her boobies.

33
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:26,771
What were you doing
seeing her boobies?

34
00:02:27,018 --> 00:02:27,814
It was an accident.

35
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:31,977
I wasn't across the street with
a telescope and a box of doughnuts.

36
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,369
Can we change the subject, please?

37
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:38,567
Because, hello? These aren't her
''boobies. '' These are her breasts.

38
00:02:40,058 --> 00:02:43,016
Pheebs, I was hoping
for more of a change.

39
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:47,408
I don't know why you're embarrassed.
They were very nice boobies.

40
00:02:48,658 --> 00:02:49,773
''Nice''?

41
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:51,213
They were ''nice''?

42
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,097
That's it?
I mean, mittens are ''nice. ''

43
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:58,369
Rock, hard place. . .

44
00:02:58,578 --> 00:02:59,374
. . .me.

45
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,007
You're so funny!

46
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:09,175
He's really funny!

47
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:13,133
I wouldn't want to be there when
the laughter stops.

48
00:03:13,858 --> 00:03:15,257
Back up there, sparky.

49
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,652
What did you mean by that?

50
00:03:19,538 --> 00:03:22,610
It seems that maybe
you have intimacy issues. . .

51
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:26,493
. . .that you use your humor
to keep people at a distance.

52
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:31,657
I mean, I just met you.
I don't know you from Adam.

53
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,453
Only child, right?

54
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:38,008
Parents divorced
before you hit puberty.

55
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:41,574
How did you know?

56
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:43,327
It's textbook.

57
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:47,447
Hey, you guys.

58
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:49,177
You all know my dad, right?

59
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:51,974
-How long are you in the city?
-Two days.

60
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:53,213
I got a job midtown.

61
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,608
I'm better off
staying with the kid. . .

62
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,968
. . .than going back and forth
on the ferry.

63
00:03:58,218 --> 00:03:59,253
I don't know this one.

64
00:03:59,658 --> 00:04:01,535
This is my friend Roger.

65
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:03,296
-Good to meet you.
-You too.

66
00:04:03,538 --> 00:04:06,211
What happened to the puppet guy?

67
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:07,214
Dad!

68
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:09,773
Excuse me.

69
00:04:09,978 --> 00:04:11,969
So, Ross, how's the wife?

70
00:04:14,258 --> 00:04:15,771
0 for 2, huh?

71
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:18,574
Chandler, quick,
say something funny!

72
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,777
Gotta go.

73
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,973
I miss you too.

74
00:04:30,218 --> 00:04:32,209
I love you,
but it's getting late now--

75
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:34,016
Let me say hi. Hey, Ma!

76
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:37,773
Listen, I made the appointment
with Dr. Bassida and--

77
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:39,967
Excuse me?

78
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:44,817
Did you know this isn't Ma?

79
00:04:53,698 --> 00:04:54,608
Her name's Ronni.

80
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:57,657
She's a pet mortician.

81
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:02,773
Sure.

82
00:05:03,938 --> 00:05:05,769
So how long have you been. . . .

83
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:12,096
Remember when you were a kid, we'd
go see the big ships in the navy yard?

84
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:13,248
Since then?

85
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,974
No, it's only been six years.

86
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,770
I wanted to give you
a nice memory. . .

87
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,090
. . .so you'd know I wasn't always
such a terrible guy.

88
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:25,888
Joe, have you ever been in love?

89
00:05:27,698 --> 00:05:28,528
I don't know.

90
00:05:29,258 --> 00:05:30,577
Then you haven't.

91
00:05:31,178 --> 00:05:32,611
You're burning your tomatoes.

92
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,007
You're one to talk.

93
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:38,369
Your dad's in love, bigtime.

94
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:41,251
And the worst part is,
it's with two different women.

95
00:05:41,498 --> 00:05:44,410
Oh, man! Please tell me
one of them is Ma.

96
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:47,456
Of course one of them's Ma.
What's the matter with you?

97
00:05:55,658 --> 00:05:58,297
It's like if you woke up one day
and found out. . .

98
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:00,534
. . .your dad was
leading this double life.

99
00:06:00,738 --> 00:06:04,572
He's like actually some spy
working for the CIA.

100
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:06,406
That'd be cool!

101
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:08,571
This blows!

102
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,490
I know. Why can't parents
just stay parents?

103
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:15,569
Why do they
have to become people?

104
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:17,649
Why do they have--

105
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:19,173
Why. . .

106
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:24,409
. . .can't you stop staring
at my breasts?

107
00:06:25,778 --> 00:06:26,767
What?

108
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:30,173
What?

109
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:33,612
Didn't you get a good enough
look the other day?

110
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:35,177
We're all adults here.

111
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:38,051
There's only one way
to resolve this.

112
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:39,737
Since you saw her boobies. . .

113
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:42,372
. . .you're gonna have to show her
your pee-pee.

114
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:53,767
You know,
I don't see that happening.

115
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:57,168
Come on. He's right.
Tit for tat.

116
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,247
Well I'm not showing you my tat!

117
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:10,567
-It's Phoebe.
-And Rog!

118
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:12,893
Come on up.

119
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,976
Oh, good! Rog is here!

120
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:20,215
-What's the matter with Rog?
-Nothing. It's a little thing.

121
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,176
I hate that guy!

122
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:26,288
What? So he was a little analytical.
That's what he does.

123
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:28,335
Come on, he's not that bad.

124
00:07:28,538 --> 00:07:31,211
That's where you're wrong!
Why would I marry her. . .

125
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:34,137
. . .if I thought on any level
that she was a lesbian?

126
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:36,372
I don't know.

127
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:38,256
Maybe you wanted
your marriage to fail.

128
00:07:43,538 --> 00:07:45,369
Why? Why would I?
Why?

129
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:51,012
I don't know.
Maybe low self-esteem?

130
00:07:51,218 --> 00:07:54,574
Maybe to compensate
for overshadowing a sibling.

131
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:57,973
Wait!
Go back to that ''sibling'' thing.

132
00:07:58,218 --> 00:08:00,778
Well, I don't know.

133
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:04,015
It's conceivable that
you sabotaged your marriage. . .

134
00:08:04,258 --> 00:08:07,728
. . .so the sibling would be less
of a failure in the parents' eyes.

135
00:08:11,338 --> 00:08:15,047
That's ridiculous!
I don't feel guilty for her failures.

136
00:08:17,858 --> 00:08:20,292
-So you think I'm a failure?
-Isn't he good?

137
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:23,653
That's not what I was saying.

138
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:25,814
I thought you were on my side. . .

139
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:28,288
. . .but maybe you were
sucking up to Mom and Dad. . .

140
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:29,567
. . .so they'd favor you.

141
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:32,087
I married a lesbian
to make you look good!

142
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:37,973
You're right.

143
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,571
I mean, you're right!

144
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,407
It wasn't just the Weebles,
but it was the Weeble Play Palace. . .

145
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,174
. . .and the Weeble's Cruise Ship. . .

146
00:08:48,418 --> 00:08:52,172
. . .which had this little lifeboat
for the Weebles to wobble in.

147
00:08:53,338 --> 00:08:55,090
That's tough, tough stuff.

148
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,575
Pheebs, if we're gonna
catch that movie, we gotta go.

149
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:00,373
Feel better, okay?

150
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:02,375
We're gonna be late, sweetie.

151
00:09:02,578 --> 00:09:04,216
Thanks for everything, Mon.

152
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:05,288
No problem.

153
00:09:05,658 --> 00:09:07,330
It was great seeing you again.

154
00:09:09,938 --> 00:09:12,691
Mon, easy on those cookies, okay?

155
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:14,974
Remember, they're just food. . .

156
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:16,537
. . .they're not love.

157
00:09:20,858 --> 00:09:22,371
I hate that guy!

158
00:09:25,938 --> 00:09:27,132
Good night, you guys.

159
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:32,572
Oh, look!
It's the woman we ordered.

160
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:38,727
Can we help you?

161
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:42,086
No, thanks. I'm just waiting
for Joey Tribbiani.

162
00:09:43,538 --> 00:09:44,891
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

163
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:48,571
Oh, no, not you. Big Joey.

164
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:49,767
Oh, my God!

165
00:09:49,978 --> 00:09:52,538
You're so much cuter than
your pictures.

166
00:09:54,938 --> 00:09:56,530
I'm Ronni.

167
00:09:59,538 --> 00:10:00,607
Cheese nip?

168
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:04,969
Joey's having an embolism. . .

169
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:06,772
. . .but I'd go for a nip.

170
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:16,493
Most people,
when their pets pass on. . .

171
00:10:16,738 --> 00:10:19,298
. . .want them laid out
like they're sleeping.

172
00:10:19,498 --> 00:10:22,535
Occasionally you get a person
who wants them in a pose.

173
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:25,378
Like chasing their tail.

174
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:29,209
Or jumping to catch a Frisbee.

175
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:33,575
Joey, if I go first, I want to be
looking for my keys.

176
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:36,851
That's a good one!

177
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,537
Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

178
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:43,017
Hello, babe!

179
00:10:43,858 --> 00:10:46,053
What are you doing here?

180
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:48,891
You left your hair
at my place.

181
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:51,413
I thought you'd need it
for your meeting.

182
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:55,134
Thank you.

183
00:10:57,178 --> 00:10:59,533
So! Who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

184
00:11:03,818 --> 00:11:04,887
Look, I. . . .

185
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:06,691
I shouldn't have come.

186
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:09,247
I gotta go.
I'll miss the last train.

187
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,449
I don't want you taking
that thing this late.

188
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:13,376
Where am I gonna stay?
Here?

189
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:16,532
We'll go to a hotel.

190
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:18,767
We'll go to a hotel.

191
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:22,169
-No, you won't.
-No, we won't.

192
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,177
If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

193
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:28,211
I want you right here,
where I can keep an eye on you.

194
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:30,010
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

195
00:11:30,218 --> 00:11:31,014
Right, mister!

196
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,818
I don't care how old you are,
while you're here. . .

197
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:36,367
. . .you're gonna live by my rules.

198
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:42,611
And that means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

199
00:11:43,258 --> 00:11:45,772
Wow, he's strict.

200
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:47,407
Dad, you'll be in my room.

201
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:50,536
Ronni, you can stay in
Chandler's room.

202
00:11:50,818 --> 00:11:53,048
Thanks.
You're a good kid.

203
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:55,214
Come on.
I'll show you to my room.

204
00:11:56,818 --> 00:12:00,572
That sounds weird when it's not
followed by, ''No, thanks, it's late! ''

205
00:12:04,618 --> 00:12:07,894
This is just for tonight.
Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.

206
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:10,527
-Six years is long enough!
-What kind of change?

207
00:12:10,778 --> 00:12:12,655
-Break up with Ronni--
-I can't!

208
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,412
Then come clean with Ma!
This is not right!

209
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:18,532
I don't wanna hear it!
Now go to my room!

210
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:33,571
Hey, kickie!

211
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:37,008
What are you doing?

212
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,577
Trying to get comfortable.

213
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:41,571
-I can't sleep in my underwear.
-Well, you're gonna.

214
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:49,366
I've been thinking. . .

215
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:52,769
. . .about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls. . . .

216
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:58,769
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

217
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:02,216
You know what I mean.
How I date all these women.

218
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,177
I always figured, when
the right one comes along. . .

219
00:13:05,378 --> 00:13:08,575
. . .I'll be able to be a standup guy
and go the distance.

220
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:11,087
Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking--

221
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:13,607
You're not him, you're you.

222
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,167
When they wanted you to go into
your father's business, did you cave?

223
00:13:19,538 --> 00:13:21,847
You chose
the out-of-work-actor business.

224
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:26,013
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

225
00:13:26,658 --> 00:13:29,491
And I believe that
when the right woman comes along. . .

226
00:13:29,698 --> 00:13:31,529
. . .you'll have the guts to say:

227
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:33,091
''No thanks, I'm married. ''

228
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:40,767
You really think so?

229
00:13:42,018 --> 00:13:43,007
I really do.

230
00:13:43,258 --> 00:13:44,771
-Thanks, Chandler.
-Get off!

231
00:13:58,378 --> 00:13:59,174
May I help you?

232
00:13:59,658 --> 00:14:03,333
Joey said I could use your shower
since Chandler's in ours.

233
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:05,974
Who are you?

234
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:09,372
Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rapalono.

235
00:14:09,698 --> 00:14:10,494
The mistress?

236
00:14:13,658 --> 00:14:15,216
-Come on in.
-Thanks.

237
00:14:15,418 --> 00:14:17,295
I'm Rachel.
Bathroom's up there.

238
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:18,408
Say, Ronni. . . .

239
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,774
How long has Chandler been
in the shower?

240
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,697
Like five minutes.

241
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:24,973
Perfect.

242
00:14:27,098 --> 00:14:28,611
Fasten your seat belts. . .

243
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,376
. . .it's pee-pee time!

244
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:37,366
Hey, Mr. Trib.

245
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:39,212
Good morning, dear.

246
00:14:40,978 --> 00:14:44,766
Chandler Bing,
it's time to see your thing.

247
00:14:56,178 --> 00:14:59,329
-What's with you?
-I thought it was Chandler!

248
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:03,088
You were supposed to be in there
so I could see your thing!

249
00:15:04,658 --> 00:15:07,377
Sorry, my thing
was in there with me.

250
00:15:15,978 --> 00:15:16,774
How's it going?

251
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:17,894
Good.

252
00:15:18,298 --> 00:15:22,291
Roger's having a dinner thing
and he wanted me to invite you guys.

253
00:15:25,578 --> 00:15:26,454
What's going on?

254
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:27,767
Nothing.

255
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:29,567
It's just that. . . .

256
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:31,568
It's Roger.

257
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:34,452
There's something about--

258
00:15:35,138 --> 00:15:36,810
Basically, we just feel
that he's. . . .

259
00:15:37,058 --> 00:15:38,047
We hate that guy!

260
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,453
We hate him!

261
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:41,137
We're sorry, Pheebs.

262
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:46,015
Don't you think maybe it's just that
he's so perceptive. . .

263
00:15:46,258 --> 00:15:47,816
. . .that it freaked you out?

264
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:49,736
-No, I hate him!
-No, we hate him!

265
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:51,053
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:05,410
Ma! What are you doing here?

267
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,574
I came to give you this. . .

268
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:09,012
. . .and this!

269
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:10,657
Big ring!

270
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:13,811
Why did you fill your father's head
with that garbage. . .

271
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,572
. . .about making things right?

272
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:18,968
Things were fine the way they were!

273
00:16:19,218 --> 00:16:21,778
There's chicken in there.
Put it away.

274
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:24,777
For God's sake, Joey!
Really.

275
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:28,616
Hold on. You knew?

276
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:31,093
Of course I knew.
What do you think?

277
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:33,613
Your father is no James Bond.

278
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:35,610
You should have heard
his cover stories.

279
00:16:35,858 --> 00:16:38,008
''I'm sleeping over at
my accountant's. ''

280
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:40,408
I mean, what is that?
Please!

281
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:42,410
So then, how could you--?

282
00:16:42,618 --> 00:16:45,007
Do you remember
how your father used to be?

283
00:16:45,258 --> 00:16:49,297
Always yelling.
Nothing made him happy.

284
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:53,087
Not that wood shop, not those
stupid little ships in the bottle.

285
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:54,771
Now he's happy.

286
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:57,486
I mean, it's nice.
He has a hobby.

287
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,175
Ma, I don't mean
to be disrespectful, but. . .

288
00:17:03,578 --> 00:17:05,011
. . .what the hell
are you saying?

289
00:17:06,738 --> 00:17:09,491
-I mean, what about you?
-Me? I'm fine.

290
00:17:10,218 --> 00:17:11,412
Look, honey. . .

291
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:13,769
. . .in an ideal world. . .

292
00:17:14,058 --> 00:17:17,095
. . .there'd be no her and your father
would look like Sting.

293
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:20,970
And I'll tell you something else:

294
00:17:21,178 --> 00:17:24,409
Ever since that
poodle-stuffer came along. . .

295
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:28,776
. . .he's been so ashamed of himself
that he's been more attentive.

296
00:17:28,978 --> 00:17:30,775
He's been more loving.

297
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,408
It's like every day is
our anniversary.

298
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,929
I'm happy for you. . .?

299
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,287
Well, don't be!

300
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:40,095
Because now everything's screwed up.

301
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:45,611
I just want it the way it was.

302
00:17:45,858 --> 00:17:48,611
Ma, I'm sorry.

303
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:52,168
I just did what
I thought you'd want.

304
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:56,172
I know you did, cookie.
I know you did.

305
00:17:59,018 --> 00:18:00,371
So tell me. . . .

306
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:02,767
Did you see her?

307
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:08,692
You're ten times prettier
than she is.

308
00:18:08,898 --> 00:18:10,172
That's sweet.

309
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:13,132
Could I take her?

310
00:18:14,858 --> 00:18:16,974
With this ring, no contest!

311
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:23,128
-What's wrong, sweetie?
-Nothing. . . .

312
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:25,776
What's wrong? Come on.

313
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:32,130
It's nothing. I'm fine.

314
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:34,215
It's just--
It's my friends.

315
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,018
They have a liking problem with you. . .

316
00:18:37,258 --> 00:18:38,407
. . .in that. . .

317
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:39,977
. . .they don't.

318
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,573
They don't?

319
00:18:45,578 --> 00:18:46,772
But you know. . .

320
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:49,691
. . .they don't see all
of the wonderfulness that I see.

321
00:18:49,938 --> 00:18:53,294
They don't see all the good stuff
and all the sweet stuff.

322
00:18:53,538 --> 00:18:55,017
They think you're a little. . . .

323
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:56,734
What?

324
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:58,087
Intense and creepy.

325
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:04,606
But I don't. Me, Phoebe.

326
00:19:06,738 --> 00:19:08,888
I'm not at all surprised
they feel that way.

327
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:11,407
You're not?
That's why you're so great.

328
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:13,814
Actually, it's
quite typical behavior. . .

329
00:19:14,058 --> 00:19:18,051
. . .when you have this kind
of dysfunctional group dynamic.

330
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:20,772
You know, this kind of codependent. . .

331
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:22,576
. . .emotionally stunted. . .

332
00:19:22,858 --> 00:19:27,773
. . .sitting in your stupid coffeehouse,
with your stupid big cups. . .

333
00:19:28,018 --> 00:19:31,215
. . .which, I'm sorry, might as well
have nipples on them.

334
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:36,896
And you're all like,
''Oh, define me! Define me!

335
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:39,771
Love me! I need love! ''

336
00:19:41,218 --> 00:19:42,776
So you talked to your dad?

337
00:19:42,978 --> 00:19:45,890
He's gonna keep cheating on Ma,
like she wanted.

338
00:19:46,178 --> 00:19:48,612
Ma's gonna keep pretending
she doesn't know.

339
00:19:48,858 --> 00:19:51,497
And my sister Tina
can't see her husband anymore. . .

340
00:19:51,738 --> 00:19:53,694
. . .because he got
a restraining order.

341
00:19:54,498 --> 00:19:57,968
Which has nothing to do with it,
except that I found out today.

342
00:19:59,138 --> 00:20:01,606
Things have changed here
on Walton's mountain.

343
00:20:03,698 --> 00:20:04,813
So Joey, are you okay?

344
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:06,487
Yeah, I guess.

345
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,888
It's just--
You know, they're parents.

346
00:20:09,138 --> 00:20:11,971
After a certain point,
you gotta let go.

347
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,777
Even if you know better. . .

348
00:20:13,978 --> 00:20:16,367
. . .you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.

349
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:17,567
And just think. . .

350
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:19,814
. . .in a few years,
we'll turn into them.

351
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:21,377
Oh, please!

352
00:20:21,618 --> 00:20:24,576
If I turn into my parents,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond. . .

353
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:27,212
. . .chasing after 20-year-old boys. . .

354
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,176
. . .or I'll end up like my mom!

355
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:36,566
How's it going?

356
00:20:37,658 --> 00:20:39,933
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

357
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:42,888
Yeah, right!

358
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:47,614
What happened?

359
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:50,373
I don't know. I mean. . . .

360
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:52,011
He's a good person. . .

361
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:54,055
. . .and he can be really sweet.

362
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:57,411
And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

363
00:20:57,658 --> 00:20:58,613
It's just. . . .

364
00:20:58,858 --> 00:20:59,973
I hate that guy!

365
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:10,613
What's going on?

366
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:13,372
Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.

367
00:21:13,618 --> 00:21:15,336
Next stop, Rachel Greene.

368
00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:23,693
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

369
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:26,373
Sorry, wrong boobies!

370
00:21:39,058 --> 00:21:40,127
Hello, Joey!

371
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:42,767
Hello, dear!

1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,010
Guys? There's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,138
Wait, wait. What is that?

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:16,932
That's Marcel. Wanna say hi?

4
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,329
No, I don't.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,531
He is precious!
Where did you get him?

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,771
My friend Bethel rescued him
from some lab.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,339
That is so cruel.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,617
Why? Why would a parent
name their child Bethel?

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,451
That monkey's got a Ross on his ass!

10
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:40,378
Is he gonna live with you,
like, in your apartment?

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,578
It's been kind of quiet
since Carol left, so. . . .

12
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,538
Why don't you just get a roommate?

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,537
I don't know.
You reach a certain age. . .

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,850
. . .having a roommate
is just kind of pathe--

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,656
Sorry, that's ''pathet,'' which is
Sanskrit for ''cool way to live. ''

16
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,816
The One With the Monkey

English Subtitles by
GELULA & CO., INC.

18
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,772
I'm doing all-new material tonight.

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,538
I have 12 new songs about my mother's
suicide and one about a snowman.

20
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,731
Might want to open with the snowman.

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,853
So how'd it go?

22
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,698
I didn't get the job.

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,498
How could you not get it?
You were Santa last year!

24
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,733
I don't know. Some fat guy's
sleeping with the store manager.

25
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,417
He's not even jolly.
It's all political.

26
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,729
What are you gonna be?

27
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,737
I'm gonna be one of his helpers.

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,813
It's just such a slap in the face,
you know?

29
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,939
Hey, do you guys know
what you're doing for New Year's?

30
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,013
Hey, what? What is wrong
with New Year's?

31
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,333
Nothing for you. You have Paolo.
You don't have to face the pressure. . .

32
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,368
. . .of finding anything with lips
to kiss when the ball drops!

33
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,178
Man, I'm talking loud!

34
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,136
For your information, Paolo's
gonna be in Rome this New Year's.

35
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,416
I'll be just as pathetic
as the rest of you.

36
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,139
Yeah, you wish.

37
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,094
I'm sick of being a victim
this Dick Clark holiday.

38
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,734
I say this year, no dates,
we make a pact.

39
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,857
Just the six of us. Dinner.

40
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,739
-Sure.
-Fine.

41
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,210
I was hoping for a little
more enthusiasm.

42
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,776
You're on.

43
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,339
Oh, good.

44
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,970
Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen,
back by popular demand. . .

45
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,450
. . .Miss Phoebe Buffay.

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,969
Thanks. Hi.

47
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:26,495
I want to start with a song that
means a lot to me this time of year.

48
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,578
I made a man with eyes of coal

49
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,892
And a smile so bewitchin '

50
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,968
How was I supposed to know

51
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,973
That my mom was dead in the kitchen?

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,095
My mother's ashes

53
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,373
Even her eyelashes

54
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,938
Are resting in a little yellow jar

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,659
And sometimes when it's freezing

56
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,459
I feel a little sneezy

57
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,535
And now I--
Excuse me? Excuse me?

58
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,576
Noisy boys.

59
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,893
Is it something you'd like
to share with the group?

60
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,299
No, that's okay.

61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,333
If it's important enough
to discuss while I'm playing. . .

62
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,418
. . .I assume it's important enough
for everyone else to hear.

63
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,690
That guy's going home with a note.

64
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,656
-I was just saying--
-Could you speak up?

65
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,015
Sorry.

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,649
I was saying you were
the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen.

67
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,532
And you said Daryl Hannah. . .

68
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:52,652
. . .was the most beautiful woman
he'd ever seen.

69
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,937
And I said I liked her in Splash,
but not in Wall Street.

70
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,893
-I thought she had a hard quality.
-A hard quality.

71
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,334
And while Daryl Hannah is beautiful
in a conventional way. . .

72
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,016
. . .you are luminous
with a kind of delicate grace.

73
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,492
Then that's when you started yelling.

74
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,136
Okay, we're gonna take a short break.

75
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:29,132
I think that guy's going home
with more than a note.

76
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,418
Come here, Marcel. Sit here.

77
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,729
Pheebs, I can't believe
he hasn't kissed you yet.

78
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,775
I mean, by my sixth date with Paolo,
he'd already named both my breasts.

79
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,495
Did I just share too much?

80
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,492
Just a smidge.

81
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,530
David's, like, a scientist guy.
He's very methodical.

82
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,729
I think it's romantic.

83
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,015
Me too!

84
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:04,571
Did you ever see
An Officer and a Gentleman?

85
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,131
He's kind of like the guy
I went to see that with.

86
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,733
Except he's smarter and gentler
and sweeter.

87
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,130
I just want to be
with him all the time.

88
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,531
You know, day and night.
And night and day.

89
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,174
And special occasions.

90
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,332
I see where this is going.
You're gonna ask him to New Year's.

91
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,140
You'll break the pact.
She's breaking the pact.

92
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,532
Yeah, could I just. . .?

93
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,450
Yeah, because I already asked Janice.

94
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,768
Come on, this was a pact!
This was your pact!

95
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,534
I couldn't handle the pressure
and I snapped!

96
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,573
But Janice?
That was the worst breakup in history!

97
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:55,254
I'm not saying it was a good idea.
I snapped!

98
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,057
Hi, sorry I'm late.

99
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,131
Too many jokes.

100
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,819
Must mock Joey.

101
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,171
Nice shoes, huh?

102
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,732
God, you're killing me!

103
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,736
He's playing with my spatulas again!

104
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,374
Look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?

105
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,451
Do you always have to bring him here?

106
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,652
I didn't want to leave him alone.

107
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,414
We had our first fight this morning.

108
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,811
It has to do with my working late.

109
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,018
I said some things that I didn't mean.

110
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,935
He threw some feces.

111
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,256
If you're working late,
I can look in on him.

112
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,931
That would be great!

113
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,133
But make sure it seems
like you're there to see him. . .

114
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,940
. . .and you're not doing it
as a favor to me.

115
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,092
Okay. But if he asks,
I'm not going to lie.

116
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,810
But you can't actually
test this theory.

117
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,973
Because today's particle accelerators
are nowhere near powerful enough. . .

118
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,131
. . .to simulate these conditions.

119
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,251
All right. I have a question then.

120
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,011
Were you planning on kissing me ever?

121
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,050
That's definitely a valid question. . .

122
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,256
. . .and the answer. . .

123
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,695
. . .would be yes.

124
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,969
Yes, I was.

125
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,531
But see, I wanted it to be
this phenomenal kiss. . .

126
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,573
. . .that happened at this
phenomenal moment because it's you.

127
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,935
Sure.

128
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,928
Right. But the longer I waited,
the more phenomenal the kiss had to be.

129
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,059
And now, it's just got to be
one of those things where I. . .

130
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,372
. . .sweep everything off the table
and throw you down on it.

131
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,134
And I'm not really
a sweeping sort of fella.

132
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:05,254
Oh, David, I think you are
a ''sweeping sort of fella. ''

133
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,532
I mean, you're a sweeper
trapped inside a physicist's body.

134
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,979
-Really.
-I'm sure of it.

135
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,973
You should just do it.
Just sweep and throw me.

136
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,016
Now?

137
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,813
Right now. Just. . . .

138
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,734
You know what?
This is just really expensive.

139
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,897
And this was a gift.

140
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,813
-Now you're just tidying up.
-Okay, what the hell?

141
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,898
-You want me to actually throw you--?
-I can hop.

142
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:01,056
Tell me something, what does
''No-Date Pact'' mean to you?

143
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,373
I'm sorry. It's just that Chandler
has somebody and Phoebe has somebody.

144
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,497
I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.

145
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,691
Fun Bobby, your ex-boyfriend,
Fun Bobby?

146
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,534
You know more than one Fun Bobby?

147
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,333
I happen to know a Fun Bob.

148
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,573
Okay. Here we go.

149
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,493
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
There's no room for milk.

150
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,736
There. Now there is.

151
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:32,212
So on our no-date evening, three
of you now are gonna have dates.

152
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,456
-Four.
-Four.

153
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,928
-Five.
-Five.

154
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,180
Sorry. Paolo's catching
an earlier flight.

155
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,776
And I met this really hot
single mom at the store.

156
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,978
What's an elf to do?

157
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:48,812
So I'm gonna be the only one standing
there alone when the ball drops?

158
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:52,735
Come on. We'll have a big party,
and no one will know who's with who.

159
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,857
This is so not what I needed now.

160
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,010
What's the matter?

161
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,613
Oh, it's Marcel.

162
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,973
He keeps shutting me out.

163
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,735
He's walking around all the time,
dragging his hands.

164
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,218
That's weird. I had a blast
with him the other night.

165
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,331
-Really?
-We played. We watched TV.

166
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,969
That juggling thing is amazing.

167
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,731
What juggling thing?

168
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,292
With the balled-up socks?
I figured you taught him that.

169
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,535
It wasn't that big a deal.
Just balled-up socks.

170
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,255
And a melon.

171
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,650
-Phoebe! Hi!
-Hi, Max. Do you know everybody?

172
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,618
No. Have you seen David?

173
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,453
No, he hasn't been around.

174
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,931
If you see him, tell him to pack.
We are going to Minsk.

175
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,330
Minsk?

176
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,132
Minsk. It's in Russia.

177
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,096
I know where Minsk is.

178
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,535
We got the grant!

179
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,459
Three years, all expenses paid.

180
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,368
So when do you leave?

181
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,496
January 1 st.

182
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,532
-What are you doing here?
-Max told me about Minsk.

183
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,977
So, you know, congratulations!
This is so exciting!

184
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,691
It'd be even more exciting,
if we were going.

185
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,894
Oh, you're not going? Oh, why?

186
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:30,850
Tell her, David.

187
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,332
''I don't want to go to Minsk to work
with Lipson and Yamaguchi and Flank.

188
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,014
I want to stay here and make out
with my girlfriend! ''

189
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,572
Okay, thank you, Max.
Thank you.

190
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,572
So you're really not going?

191
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,857
I don't know. I don't know
what I'm gonna do. I just. . . .

192
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,456
You decide.

193
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,135
-Don't do that.
-Please?

194
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,329
But I'm asking you.

195
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,979
I can't make a decision.

196
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,972
-Please, just--
-Okay. Stay.

197
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,499
-Stay.
-Stay.

198
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,938
Getting so good at that!

199
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,258
It was Max's stuff.

200
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,970
I love this artichoke thing.

201
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,576
Don't tell me what's in it.
The diet starts tomorrow.

202
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,139
You remember Janice.

203
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,289
Vividly.

204
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,450
Hi, I'm Sandy.

205
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,816
Sandy, hi. Come on in.

206
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,336
You brought your kids.

207
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,252
Yeah. That's okay, right?

208
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,899
Party!

209
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,654
That thing is not coming in here!

210
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:10,131
''That thing''? This is how
you greet guests at a party?

211
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,009
If I showed up with my new girlfriend,
she wouldn't be welcome?

212
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,492
Your new girlfriend
wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.

213
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,817
He was more embarrassed
about that than anyone.

214
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,175
And for him to have the courage
to walk back in here. . .

215
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,419
. . .like nothing happened. . . .

216
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,452
All right. All right.
Just keep him away from me.

217
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,895
Thank you. Come on, Marcel.

218
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,655
What do you say you and I
do a little mingling?

219
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,054
All right. . .

220
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,931
. . .I'll catch up with you later.

221
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,892
Oh, my God! Rachel, honey. . .

222
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,698
. . .are you okay?

223
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,969
Where's Paolo?

224
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,609
Rome.

225
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,612
Jerk missed his flight.

226
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,573
And then your face exploded?

227
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,139
I was at the airport
getting into a cab. . .

228
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,659
. . .when this woman. . .

229
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,494
. . .this blond planet
with a pocketbook. . .

230
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,574
. . .starts yelling at me.

231
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,334
Something about how
it was her cab first.

232
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,414
The next thing I know, she just
starts pulling me out by my hair!

233
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,379
And I started blowing my attack
whistle thingy. . .

234
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,134
. . .and then three more cabs show up.

235
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,777
So as I'm going to get into a cab,
she tackles me!

236
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,135
And I hit my head on the curb
and cut my lip on my whistle.

237
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,896
Everybody having fun at the party?

238
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,135
Are people eating my dip?

239
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,969
When I saw you at the store
last week. . .

240
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,818
. . .it was probably the first time
I ever mentally undressed an elf.

241
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,851
Wow, that's dirty!

242
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,016
Hey, kids.

243
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,856
Look at him. I'm not saying he has
to spend the whole evening with me. . .

244
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,772
. . .but at least check in.

245
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,051
There you are!

246
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,060
You got away from me.

247
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,291
But you found me.

248
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,218
Here, Ross, take our picture.

249
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,696
Smile. You're on Janice Camera.

250
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,138
Kill me. Kill me now.

251
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,732
Everybody, it's Fun Bobby!

252
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,935
Hey, sorry I'm late.

253
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,131
But my grandfather. . .

254
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,978
. . .died about two hours ago.

255
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,059
But I couldn't get a flight
out till tomorrow, so. . .

256
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,774
. . .here I am.

257
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,415
Hey, Fun Bobby!
How's it going, man?

258
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,334
Whoa! Who died?

259
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,373
It's going to be an open casket,
you know?

260
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,218
So at least I'll get to see him again.

261
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,571
I'm gonna blow this one up and
I'm gonna write ''Reunited'' in glitter.

262
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,776
All right, Janice, that's it!

263
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,258
When I invited you, I didn't
think it meant that we--

264
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,650
Oh, no!

265
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,855
-I'm sorry you misunderstood.
-Oh, my God!

266
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,336
You listen to me!
You listen to me!

267
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,131
One of these times, it's just gonna be
your last chance with me!

268
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,851
Will you give me the thing?

269
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,176
Hi, Max.

270
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,655
Yoko.

271
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,697
I've decided to go to Minsk
without you.

272
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,132
It won't be the same. . .

273
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,932
. . .but it will still be Minsk.

274
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,698
Happy New Year.

275
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,539
Are you all right?

276
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,817
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

277
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,455
You're going to Minsk.

278
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,531
No, I'm not going to Minsk.

279
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,332
Oh, you are so going to Minsk.

280
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,458
You belong in Minsk.
You can't stay here just for me.

281
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,772
Yes, I can. Because if I go,
it means I have to break up with you.

282
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,137
-And I can't break up with you.
-Oh, yes. Yes, you can.

283
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,572
Just say, ''Phoebe, I love you,
but my work is my life.

284
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,412
That's what I have to do now. ''

285
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,413
And I say, ''Your work?
How can you say that?''

286
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:55,575
And then you say,
''It's tearing me apart. . .

287
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,334
. . .but I have no choice.
Can't you understand that?''

288
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,252
And I say, ''No!

289
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,139
No! I can't understand that! ''

290
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,170
Sorry.

291
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,380
And then you put
your arms around me. . . .

292
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,333
Put your arms around me.

293
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,695
Sorry.

294
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,290
And then you tell me you love me
and you'll never forget me.

295
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,535
I'll never forget you.

296
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,579
Then you say that it's almost
midnight and you have to go. . .

297
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,211
. . .because you don't want to start
the year with me if you can't finish it.

298
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,739
I'm gonna miss you. . .

299
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,852
. . .you scientist guy.

300
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,017
Hi, this is Dick Clark live
in Times Square.

301
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:46,936
We're in a virtual snowstorm
of confetti here in Times Square.

302
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,818
It gets better every year.

303
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,413
Here you go, kids.

304
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,934
And then the peacock bit me.

305
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,452
Please kiss me at midnight!

306
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,250
You seen Sandy?

307
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,775
I don't know how to tell you this. . .

308
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,808
. . .but she's in the bedroom getting it
on with Max, that scientist geek.

309
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,529
Cool, look at that.
I did know how to tell you.

310
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,935
Hey, everybody, the ball is going.

311
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,129
What?

312
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,891
The ball is dropping!

313
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,695
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

314
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,539
And the moment of joy is upon us.

315
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,938
Looks like that ''No-Date Pact'' thing
worked out.

316
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,729
Everybody looks so happy.
I hate that!

317
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,135
Not everybody is happy.
Hey, Bobby!

318
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,934
--four, three, two. . .

319
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,859
. . .one! Happy New Year!

320
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,658
I just thought I'd throw this out.
I'm no math whiz. . .

321
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,132
. . .but I do believe there are
three girls and three guys right here.

322
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,773
I don't feel like kissing
anyone tonight.

323
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,738
I can't kiss anyone.

324
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,658
So I'm kissing everyone?

325
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,416
You can't kiss Ross.
That's your brother.

326
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,059
Perfect. So now everybody's
getting kissed but me.

327
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,528
Somebody kiss me.

328
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,369
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!
Somebody kiss me! It's midnight!

329
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,451
All right! All right! All right!

330
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,809
There!

331
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,568
I wanted this to work so much.

332
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,858
I'm still in there, you know?

333
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:29,012
Changing his diapers.
Picking his fleas.

334
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,735
But he's just phoning it in.

335
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,648
It's hard to accept
that something you love so much. . .

336
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,016
. . .doesn't love you back, you know?

337
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,738
I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
