Meereen is strong.

The Masters cannot

21

I will crucify the Masters.

If you had not been so arrogant,

52
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:47,504
you could have returned to your
homeland with a fleet of ships.

53

We'll find out soon enough.

172
00:15:38,003 --> 00:15:42,338

<i>the walls of Winterfell
and wait us out.</i>

175
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:06,529
That's not his way. He knows
the North is watching.

176
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,464
If the other houses
sense weakness on his part,

177
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:11,266
they'll stop fearing him.

178
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:14,036
He can't have that.
Fear is his power.

179
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,738
It's his weakness, too. His men
don't want to fight for him.

180
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,441
They're forced to fight for him.
If they feel the tide turning...

181
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:21,843
It's not his men that worry me.

182
00:16:21,845 --> 00:16:23,278
It's his horses.

183
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,547
I know what mounted
knights can do to us.

184
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:28,783
You and Stannis cut through us
like piss through snow.

185
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:31,118
We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

186
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,421
They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

187
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:34,756
in a double envelopment.

188
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:40,628
A pincer move.

189
00:16:45,535 --> 00:16:48,135
They won't be able
to hit us from the sides.

190
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:50,037
Good.

191
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:55,276
It's crucial that
we let them charge at us.

192
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,280
They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

193
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:05,218
If we let him buckle
our center, he'll pursue.

194
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,789
Then we'll have him
surrounded on three sides.

195
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:12,593
Did you really think that cunt
would fight you man-to-man?

196
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:15,328
No.

197
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:17,230
But I wanted to make him angry.

198
00:17:19,835 --> 00:17:22,268
I want him coming at us full tilt.

199
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:26,106

Aye, for what they're worth.

204

You've known him for the space

205

you and your trusted advisors,

206

00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:03,241
I know the way his mind works.

210
00:18:03,243 --> 00:18:06,410
I know how he likes to hurt people.

211
00:18:06,412 --> 00:18:10,681
Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

212
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,885
You're right.

213
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,622
You think he's going
to fall into your trap.

214
00:18:17,624 --> 00:18:19,990
He won't. He's the
one who lays traps.

215
00:18:19,992 --> 00:18:22,893
- <i>He's overconfident.</i>
- He plays with people.

216
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,630
He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

217
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:28,565
Aye, and what have I been doing all
my life? Playing with broomsticks?

218
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:32,469
I fought beyond the Wall against
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

219
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:35,305
I've defended the Wall
from worse than Ramsay Bolton.

220
00:18:35,307 --> 00:18:37,875
You don't know him.

221
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:41,178
All right, tell me.

222
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,047
What should we do?
How do we get Rickon back?

223
00:18:45,984 --> 00:18:47,750
We'll never get him back.

224
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:52,255
Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

225
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,090
which makes him
a greater threat to Ramsay

226
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,260
than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

227
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,296
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

228
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:03,900
which means he won't live long.

229
00:19:03,902 --> 00:19:06,368
We can't give up on our brother.

230
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,538
Listen to me, please. He
wants you to make a mistake.

231
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,709
Of course he does.
What should I do differently?

232
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:14,877
I don't know. I don't know
anything about battles.

233
00:19:14,879 --> 00:19:18,380
Just don't do
what he wants you to do.

234
00:19:18,382 --> 00:19:19,682
Aye, that's good advice.

235
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:21,183
You think that's obvious?

236
00:19:21,185 --> 00:19:22,618
Well, it is a bit obvious.

237
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,985
If you had asked
for my advice earlier,

238
00:19:23,987 --> 00:19:25,754
I would have told you
not to attack Winterfell

239
00:19:25,756 --> 00:19:28,190
until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

240
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:30,559
When will we have a larger force?

241
00:19:30,561 --> 00:19:32,728
We've pleaded with every
house that'll have us.

242
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,062
The Blackfish can't help us.

243
00:19:34,064 --> 00:19:36,131
We're lucky to have this many men.

244
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,634
- It's not enough.
- No, it's not enough. It's what we have.

245
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:47,976
Battles have been won
against greater odds.

246
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:56,284
If Ramsay wins,

247
00:19:56,286 --> 00:19:58,319
I'm not going back there alive.

248
00:19:58,321 --> 00:19:59,987
Do you understand me?

249
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:06,493
I won't let ever
let him touch you again.

Mance didn't have
demons in his skull.

271
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:27,172
He didn't torch people
or listen to some red witch.

But I was wrong just like you.

275

Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

00:27:01,931 --> 00:27:05,566
But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

341
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:07,635
You've brought us 100 ships
from the Iron Fleet

342
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:09,370
<i>with men to sail them.</i>

343
00:27:09,372 --> 00:27:11,673
In return, I expect
you want me to support

344
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:14,208
your claim to the throne
of the Iron Islands?

345
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,210
Not my claim.
Hers.

346
00:27:16,212 --> 00:27:18,312
And what's wrong with you?

347
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:19,880
I'm not fit to rule.

348
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:21,582
We can agree upon that at least.

349
00:27:21,584 --> 00:27:24,251
Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

350
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:25,852
No more than Westeros.

351
00:27:27,623 --> 00:27:31,058
Our Uncle Euron returned home
after a long absence.

352
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,694
He murdered our father and took
the Salt Throne from Yara.

353
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:37,263
He would have murdered us
if we'd stayed.

354
00:27:38,733 --> 00:27:41,900
Lord Tyrion tells me your
father was a terrible king.

355
00:27:41,902 --> 00:27:44,036
You and I have that in common.

356
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,905
We do.

357
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:49,242
And both murdered
by a usurper as well.

358
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:52,244
Will their ships be enough?

359
00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:55,380
With the former Masters'
fleet, possibly.

360
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,515
Barely.

361
00:27:57,517 --> 00:28:00,318
There are more than 100
ships in the Iron Fleet.

362
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,821
There are and Euron is building more.

363
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:04,556
He's going to offer them to you.

364
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,058
So why shouldn't I wait for him?

365
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,727
The Iron Fleet
isn't all he's bringing.

366
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,928
He also wants
to give you...

367
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,666
His big cock, I think he said.

368
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:18,002
<i>Euron's offer is also an
offer of marriage, you see.</i>

369
00:28:18,004 --> 00:28:19,871
<i>You won't get one
without the other.</i>

370
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:22,507
And I imagine your offer is
free of any marriage demands?

371
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:25,810
I never demand, but I'm
up for anything, really.

What if everyone starts
demanding their independence?

384
00:28:56,474 --> 00:28:58,608
She's not demanding,
